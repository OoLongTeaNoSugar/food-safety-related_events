Jac Vandenberg Inc., an international company with headquarters on Corporate Boulevard, notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week that it was issuing the recall. On Monday, company officials said that no illnesses had been reported.

The company said routine testing detected Listeria monocytogenes in the fruit, though no illness have been reported at this time. WHOLE FOODS RECALLS BABY SPINACH-CONTAINING FOOD PRODUCTS

Among the different serovars, Dublin (S. Dublin) is of particular importance due to its propensity to progress to an invasive infection in humans and due to the high proportion of multi-drug resistant strains in Canada. Cattle are considered as the main reservoir of S. Dublin. This serotype has emerged since 2011 in the province of Quebec, Canada, in both cattle and human populations.

He was dazed and bloodied, and taken off the ice on a stretcher. Edler was knocked unconscious and taken to hospital for further evaluation and X-rays on his face.

Ma a volte, come in questo caso, non basta una vita: parliamo di un esperimento di microbiologia che durerà 500 anni.
